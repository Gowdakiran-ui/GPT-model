ðŸ‘‰ This repo is the clean minimal base. You can later expand with:
- Tokenizers (BPE/WordPiece)
- Larger datasets (`datasets` library)
- Training on GPU/colab
- Checkpoint saving & resuming

---

Do you want me to **make this repo production-ready** (proper `input.txt`, tokenizer, and saving/loading checkpoints) or just keep it **minimal working GPT** for now?
